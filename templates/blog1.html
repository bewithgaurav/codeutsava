							<h5>#RaipurIsBeautiful</h5>
							<br/>
								<p>As a metropolitan city that everything changes, changes in the extinction is not the case that old things are just the same,
								just the way it turns, it comes in a new look.
								One such city is Raipur, new things have come here, as well as new people.This city, is like other cities of India is changing and changing times have made its mark on the traditions and legacy was forgotten. The people in the face of urbanization is changing the town’s people were progressive and thoughts. Those who were already going in Tokijo for the cinema every Sunday they are going to the movies in Multiplex.
								
								Mall has took place in the place of market now, but still Golbajar sounds here, today with the same pride pan are eaten as earlier but now there is change in the color of pan it looks a bit faded.
								
								If you visit Kalibadhi during summer days, the pot sellers still sits there who all are selling pots since 10 years the pots where brought by the people who have refrigerator in their home and that too with a double-door,but now the difference is the pot are coming attach with water tapDue to indiscriminate urbanization urban ,people are engaged in converting themselves in urbanization and now being a urban here is a proud thing. it is just like some people who used to travel in bike is now travelling in car.
							
								One of the main reason in establishing is the growing rate of the people, people are coming here from other cities, since their is chance for them to appear here, and they’re bringing their culture along with them.
							
								This city is not the city of Chattisgadio you can see anywhere in the city or anywhere the board of Sindhi society or the Sikh community or Gujarati society, but why don’t you find any aboriginal ( adivasi) samajh board. Why?
								
								For whom this city, this state was built,if there is no existence of that people than their is no mean to be in the city if you visit Ahmedabad, Amritsar you’ll see the same people, in the stores or an intersection, a turn or a lane, but when you come to Raipur you will hardly find a single Chattisgdi, Why is it so?
								
								If this continues then Raipur will also be not “Raipur” or it will transformed into a new Raipur and the governor will be from other people but not Chasttisgdi.
								
								Now people are coming to the city from the village for migrating them self into urbanization .Migration is now an old word people are now adapting it as a needed way to stop terrorizing the process is a society because people are now leaving the old visitation earlier seller comes with flute in the markets now comes with Chinese toys.
								
								Just so little is changed but “so much has changed”.
								
								Things have changed, people have changed.
								</p>
