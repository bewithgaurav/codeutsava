							<h5>#RaipurIsBeautiful</h5>
							<br/>
								<p>Raipur,the place I hated the most with no reason.It was 28th of march 2013,I came here to pursue chartered accountancy course.I have completely drawn my mind from the pool of science and was sure that I will be a Chartered Accountant one day.<br/>
								I have attended classes at Xcel and hosteled at some flat near Pachpedi Naka.The friends the classes the competition and the subject were awesome.I was enjoying those struggling phase with commerce students as being a science student at school I had 
								never been with these people.There was a "Chuski (barfgola) shop" in front of our class and the tasty samosa and poha which I haven't tasted here till now.<br/>
								<br/>
								April 7,JEE MAINS was there and honestly saying I have forgotten everything a out science and was filled with supply and demand graph, credit and debit,laws etc.But I appeared for it and also cleared it.When I saw the rank and chances of getting selected I
								was really sad that I was entering to the engineering field which I have left far behind.I have cleared the entrance of CA too at the same time.<br/><br/>
								My path was divided into two halves but I knew I will get the destination only at one.And I have chosen NIT RAIPUR .<br/><br/>
								Yeah RAIPUR is not too bad.Nah! It's not that good.Haha.<br/><br/>
								It was my situation.At a time I praised and another second I criticized.It started with Hostel E, Central garden, Chemistry Lab, Physics lab,ED classes,Mechanics lab and the survey practicals.<br/><br/>
								Sharing a single piece of paneer in three pieces with Aditi and Parul is still in the memory bucket of college.<br/><br/>
								RK mall our only destination for movie and the first place I have tasted Domino's pizza.<br/><br/>
								I have come here with a childish face with no eyebrows threading , no waxing ,no step cut hairstyle and of course no sense of getup.I have come here with same mindset of doing class work daily at room,the sincerity,the 90% attendance and yup was hungry for pointers.<br/><br/>
								And now it's "wow". <br/>
								That silent,scared and introvert being has changed to an independent , confident and a smart personality.<br/><br/>
								First year drama people,nukkad buddies,meta seniors and of course some seniors who are none less than a life liner has shaped my personality with their selflessness.<br/><br/>
								I can't forget the "mandir" behind our college where we have practiced for 10-12hrs for nukkad.<br/><br/>
								It's the place where I have grown up as a good friend of someone and a worst enemy for other.The place where I have learnt to value the relationshipsThe place that makes me so much strong that it needs a lot of effort to break this heart and zeal.<br/><br/>
								I have got many good friends with whom I have captured beautiful moments to be cherished for the whole life and believe me it will always bring a smile on my face doesn't matter how old I will be.There are friends who has left me but on the other side some good souls have lift me,has grown with me and are still standing by myside each day.I have knitted a strong thread with those beautiful people. <br/><br/>
								I haven't noticed that when my mind departed from "craving for good pointers" to "getting into dream company".The maturity along with new childish behavior has entered my habits in no time.Actually I should say in very short span of 3 years 5 months.<br/><br/>
								It is the place where I have got the love of my life.The person whose gives me a reason each day to smile and to live as if there is no tomorrow.<br/><br/>
								Yo man!I am in love now with the beauty in the air of Raipur.<br/><br/>
								"Nukkad", "Mocha" , "Babylon ","Ambuja food court","Marine drive" "Ghatarani " <br/><br/>
								And every creative destination where I have been to has stamped a sweetness in my heart.<br/><br/>
								RAIPUR is beautiful in the way it captures the heart to live for more.<br/><br/>
								The journey is still continuing as three more months are remaining to live by.<br/><br/>
								Three more months to enjoy and explore the perfect place in this imperfect Raipur.<br/>
